# SPM Project
A company that sells has hired some phone operators and some sales agents.
• Each sales agent decides its own schedule for each day of the week that he wants to work. Then the phone operators call potential customers and try to set up meetings in a schedule that fits with sales agents. Then, the sales agents go into the meeting and try to convince the clients to buy the water filter. If the client buys the water filter, then the sales agent and the phone agents get a certain commission.
• The whole work here is supervised by the Marketing Chief who facilitates and checks the work of each of the team members.





• However, each sale should be checked with the chief of operations first, before releasing commissions. When sales agents go to each client, they will try to get some referrals, in order to have the phone agents call them again. And in this way they build a cycle. For each new referral, the sales agents will also get them a fixed commission. The sale is a revenue but the commissions are an expense.


• The chief of operations should see in their own dashboard the earnings they have in the month until now.
• Then the chief of operations will see the sale and will assign a technician to go and assemble the water filter. 
Each water filter should have the small filters inside changed one year from the date that it is assembled. Anytime
that the small filters are changed it is called a small sale so it should be added to the revenue. Whenever new
items are added to the inventory, they should be added as expenses. So for each month we know how much we
have earned and how many expenses we've had.




• The administrator dashboard is going to manage everything and the storage manager.
• The storage manager should manage three types of storage. One is the big storage which is in a remote location and he is directly responsible for that. The second one is the small storage that is located in the office. The third type of storage is the one that every technician has in his car in his daily work.
• The storages should work on this way. The small storage manager (chief of operations) asks for storage from the storage manager. What goes out from the big storage, goes in in the small storage. The same thing happens with the small storage and the technicians storages.




• In this way every article goes all the way from the big storage, to the small one, to the technician and finally to the client.
